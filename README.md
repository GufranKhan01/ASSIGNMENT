#  Task 2 

# Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

This is a simple Python script that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.

## ðŸ“œ ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- The variable n is initialized to 0.

- A for loop iterates from 1 to 50 (inclusive).

- Each number is added to n using the += operator.

- After the loop, the total sum is printed.
