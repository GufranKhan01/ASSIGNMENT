# **ðŸ”¥ ASSIGNMENT 2 ðŸ”¥**
# Even or Odd Checker

This is a simple Python script that checks whether a number entered by the user is even or odd.

## How it Works

The script:
1. Prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Converts the input into an integer.
3. Checks if the number is divisible by 2.
4. Prints whether the number is even or odd.


#  Task 2 

# Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

This is a simple Python script that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.

## ðŸ“œ ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- The variable n is initialized to 0.

- A for loop iterates from 1 to 50 (inclusive).

- Each number is added to n using the += operator.

- After the loop, the total sum is printed.

# Extract and Reverse

This simple Python program demonstrates how to work with tuples and slicing in Python. It extracts the first five elements from a predefined tuple of numbers and then reverses those elements.

## Features

- Uses a tuple of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Extracts the first five elements.
- Reverses the extracted elements.
- Prints the original, extracted, and reversed data.

# Sample Output
Original list: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
Extracted first five elements (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Reversed extracted elements: (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
