# Even or Odd Checker

This is a simple Python script that checks whether a number entered by the user is even or odd.

## How it Works

The script:
1. Prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Converts the input into an integer.
3. Checks if the number is divisible by 2.
4. Prints whether the number is even or odd.
